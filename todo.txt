1. Turn TableRowExtractor into a more general class. Maybe have getRowData() return a hack datastructure. The possibilites are tuple, array, Map<string, tuple>, etc.
   
   Currently getRowData() put each row into an array, which is inserted in a outer array that is a private class member variable. 
   It would be better to declare either a Vector<Vector <> > or if an associative array is needed Vector< Map<string, tuple> > -- something along
   these lines.

2. Use a filter iterator with it to filter onl US stocks.
3. Use a function object of some sort to apply to each row extracted, or create a separat

UNDERSTAND the current logic. Then redesign it using Hack data structures and typing and SPL iterators.
