1. Add url verification to the input validation. See the  url_exists($url) method in AbstractXXXX or NandishXXX
2. Have getRowData() return a hack datastructe. The possibilites are tuple, array, Map<string, tuple>, etc.
   
   Currently getRowData() put each row into an array, which is inserted in a outer array that is a private class member variable. 
   It would be better to declare either a Vector<Vector <> > or if an associative array is needed Vector< Map<string, tuple> > -- something along
   these lines.

3. Perhaps an derived FilterIterator can be used in the implementation of NandishXXXX, which would do what getNextUSStock() currently does.


UNDERSTAND the current logic. Then redesign it using Hack data structures and typing and SPL iterators.
