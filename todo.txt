Compare intent, the design, with reworked code. Make the code more organzied. Use Hack collections. Follow the examples used in Martin BÃ¶rger's pdf presentations. 
Such thoughts include:

1. Turn TableRowExtractor into a more general class. Maybe have getRowData() return a hack datastructure. The possibilites are tuple, array, Map<string, tuple>, etc.

   Currently getRowData() put each row into an array, which is inserted in a outer array that is a private class member variable. 
   It would be better to declare either a Vector<Vector <> > or if an associative array is needed Vector< Map<string, tuple> > -- something along
   these lines.

2. Use a filter iterator it to filter only US stocks and to apply other filer criteria.
