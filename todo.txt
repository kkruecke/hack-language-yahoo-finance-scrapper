This iterator
class YahooTableIterator implements \KeyedIterator<int, \Vector<string>> {
  /....
}

the compiler doesn't like. I don't know why. Did I fail to implement 
  public function  key() : <int> 

?
 
3. LimitIterator may not work with the way YahooTable::getCellText() is currently designed. Write some code to test specifically how LimitIterator works.
   Does it move linearly or does it have a random access-like capability?
